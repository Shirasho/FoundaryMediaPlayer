### Remarks

The application is currently in development and does not produce any output at this time. Please wait for a future release before branching.

### About FMP
Foundary Media Player (FMP) is a media player written in C#. FMP uses the native API for the operating system, allowing it to support any media format your operating system can. This also means you can install custom codecs and FMP should be able to play that format. For example, FMP for Windows uses DirectShow, allowing you to use native renderers and filters such as [madVR](http://madvr.com/) and [xy-VSFilter](https://github.com/Cyberbeing/xy-VSFilter).

### Goals

* Comparable performance to native C/C++ media players.
* Support as many new and existing media formats as possible.
* A more modern interface compared to existing alternatives.
* Video processing and gif saving.
* Cross-platform support.

### Credits

This project would not be possible without the help of [MPC-HC](https://mpc-hc.org/)'s [source code](https://github.com/mpc-hc/mpc-hc). Until this media player is ready for use, please consider using their product.
